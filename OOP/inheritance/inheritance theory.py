'''Inheritance:

parent class- supperclass/base class
child class- base class/ derived class


one class(child class) inherits properties and methods from another class(parent class)  

Advantages of inheritance:
1. Code Reusability(class reuse the methods and properties of an existing class)
2. improved readability (changes in base class automatically refect in derived class)
3.extensibility (new functionality can be add to derived class without modifying base class)
4. polymorphism support (allows overriding )
5 reduce complexity
6.faster development time (faster develoment by using pre-existing features)


Types of inheritance
1.single inheritance
2.multiple level inheritance
3. multiple inheritance
4. hierarchical inheritance
5. hybrid inheritance


1) single inheritance - 
only one parent class and child class

2) multiple level inheritance - 
more than one levels

3) multiple inheritance -
multiple parent class and only one child class

4) hierarchical inheritance -
only one parent class and multiple child class

5) hybrid inheritance
combination of any two inheritance
